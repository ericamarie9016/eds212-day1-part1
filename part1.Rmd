## Derivatives in R

Find the derivative of $f(x) = 5x^2$ $$f(x) = 5x^2$$ Format equations with single (hover) or double (own box) dollar signs, similar to LATEX language

```{r}
ex_1 <- expression(5 * x ^ 2) #Expression allows addition of undefined component x

deriv_1 <- deriv(ex_1, "x") #add variable to take derivative in respect to
deriv_1

# Find slope at x = 2.8
x <- 2.8
eval(deriv_1)

```

Another way to do derivatives:
Find the slope of $g(z) = 2z^3 - 10.5z^2 + 4.1$

```{r}
gz <- expression(2 * z^3 - 10.5 * z^2 + 4.1)
dg_dz <- D(gz, 'z')
dg_dz

# Evaluate slope over a range of values, define it as z in the equation
z <- seq(from = -7, to = 4, by = .75)
eval(dg_dz)

```


SOME AWESOME TEXT!!
